chromium-update
=========

A Windows PowerShell script that automatically finds the latest official Windows build of the Chromium browser, and if it is newer than the current version, downloads and installs it.

Since Windows has no native package manager and the Chromium builds don't have a built-in updater, I decided to make it easier for me to keep up-to-date versions of the browser installed. This script might be deprecated by Microsoft's OneGet package management â€” as it becomes stable this project might not be the best option for Chromium on Windows.
